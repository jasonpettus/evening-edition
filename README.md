Love your RSS reader, but miss the elegance and visual heirarchy of a traditional newspaper? What about all those times when you get served up half a dozen versions of the same story? **Evening Edition** is a Rubyfied feed reader that addresses both of these concerns: designed to be read only once a day, it lays out its stories in a manner pleasing to the eye, with visual clues as to what events are being talked about the most; and it examines these stories long before you read them, grouping similar articles together so that you see only one version (with a button that lets you see the rest).
